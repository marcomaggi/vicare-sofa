Subject: [announce] Vicare/SOFA revision 0.4d1

			      Vicare/SOFA
			      ===========


This package is a distribution of Scheme libraries for Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant  Scheme implementation in  the form of a  native compiler
for  x86  architectures,  officially supporting  GNU+Linux  systems;  it
provides  bindings  for  the  C   language  library  SOFA,  Standars  of
Fundamental Astronomy.

  The International Astronomical Union's SOFA Collection consists of two
libraries of  routines, one  coded in  Fortran 77 the  other in  ANSI C.
There is  a suite of  vector/matrix routines and various  utilities that
underpin  the  astronomy  algorithms,  which include  routines  for  the
following:

* Calendars

* Time Scales

* Earth rotation and sidereal time

* Ephemerides (medium precision)

* Geocentric/geodetic transformations

* Precession, nutation, polar motion

* Star space motion

* Star catalogue conversion

  *NOTE* The last  time the author bothered to update  this paragraph he
had tested the SOFA C library version: "SOFA-Issue: 2013-12-02" packaged
in ATSOFA 0.2d0.

  This package makes use of the GNU Autotools.

  The latest version of this package can be downloaded from:

	<https://bitbucket.org/marcomaggi/vicare-sofa/downloads>

the home page of the Vicare project is at:

	       <http://marcomaggi.github.io/vicare.html>

development takes place at:

	      <http://github.com/marcomaggi/vicare-sofa/>

and as backup at:

	<https://bitbucket.org/marcomaggi/vicare-sofa/downloads>

  The SOFA libraries  along with documentation and other  goodies can be
found at:

		       <http://www.iausofa.org/>

but it is suggested to use the repackaged distribution at:

		 <http://github.com/marcomaggi/atsofa/>

which makes use of the GNU Autotools.
