1. Introduction
---------------

This package is a distribution of Scheme libraries for Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant  Scheme implementation;  it provides  bindings for  the C
language library SOFA, Standars of Fundamental Astronomy.

  The International Astronomical Union's SOFA Collection consists of two
libraries of  routines, one  coded in  Fortran 77 the  other in  ANSI C.
There is  a suite of  vector/matrix routines and various  utilities that
underpin  the  astronomy  algorithms,  which include  routines  for  the
following:

* Calendars

* Time Scales

* Earth rotation and sidereal time

* Ephemerides (medium precision)

* Geocentric/geodetic transformations

* Precession, nutation, polar motion

* Star space motion

* Star catalogue conversion

  *NOTE* The last  time the author bothered to update  this paragraph he
had tested the SOFA C library version: "SOFA-Issue: 2013-12-02" packaged
in ATSOFA 0.2d0.

  This package makes use of the GNU Autotools.

3. Install
----------

3.1 Installing SOFA
-------------------

First we must install SOFA; this package  is meant to use the C language
library  implemented   by  the  International  Astronomical   Union  and
distributed  using the  GNU Autotools  in  the ATSOFA  package (see  the
appendix "Resources").  It is just a matter of doing:

    $ cd atsofa-0.2.0
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../configure
    $ make all
    $ make check
    $ make install


3.2 Installing Vicare/SOFA
--------------------------

Before installing  Vicare/SOFA make sure  to have a  correctly installed
Sofa library and Vicare Scheme.

  To install Vicare/SOFA  from a proper release tarball,  we must unpack
the archive then do:

   $ cd vicare-sofa-0.4.0
   $ mkdir build
   $ cd build
   $ ../configure
   $ make
   $ make check
   $ make install

notice  that  the  "configure"  script  is  prepared  to  enable  shared
libraries  and  disable static  libraries:  this  must not  be  changed,
because  the package  is  meant to  install  a C  shared  library to  be
dynamically loaded.

  The Makefile is designed to allow parallel builds, so we can do:

   $ make -j4 all && make -j4 check

which,  on  a  4-core  CPU,   should  speed  up  building  and  checking
significantly.

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the  "DESTDIR" environment variable to install
the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/vicare-sofa

  If, instead,  we have checked out  a revision from the  repository, we
will have  to first build the  infrastructure running a script  from the
top source directory:

   $ cd vicare-sofa
   $ sh autogen.sh

notice  that  "autogen.sh"  will   run  the  programs  "autoreconf"  and
"libtoolize"; the  latter is  selected through the  environment variable
"LIBTOOLIZE",  whose  value  can  be  customised;  for  example  to  run
"glibtoolize" rather than "libtoolize" we do:

   $ LIBTOOLIZE=glibtoolize sh autogen.sh

  After this the  procedure is the same  as the one for  building from a
proper release tarball, but we have to enable maintainer mode:

    $ ../configure --enable-maintainer-mode [options]
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

  Libraries are installed under the directory:

			$(libdir)/vicare-scheme

on 32-bit platforms we should arrange such library to be:

		      $(prefix)/lib/vicare-scheme

on 64-bit platforms we should arrange such library to be:

		     $(prefix)/lib64/vicare-scheme

  The variable VFLAGS is available  to the user when running "configure"
and "make" to add command line options to the execution of "vicare" when
compiling libraries and running tests; for example:

   $ make VFLAGS="-g -O2 --option print-loaded-libraries"

Vicare/SOFA  was written  by  Marco  Maggi.  Vicare  Scheme  is an  R6RS
compliant  fork  of  Ikarus  Scheme;  originally  created  by  Abdulaziz
Ghuloum, it is now maintained by Marco Maggi.
